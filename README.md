Week 3
After the project plan. I was created the project by android studio in week 3.
As the project said, I was created four screens which are GameActivity, GameProgressActivity, MainActivity and SettingActivity. all Activities added the buttons, seek-bar. I was used the Intent code and Action bar to make each activities can be switched each other.











Week 4
I was created the login and sign up system. Just want to make game project become more professional. I set the login and sign up screens as new background colour and same as the button.
But didnâ€™t change the other screen background and button colours. still want to make it better, try other frames and colour. 











Week 5
I was created the database system and make the users can create account and login successful. Changed the exit button direction onto login activity both on main activity and setting activity.
Set the font size.



# Henry comments 27/April
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Where is your changelog.md file?
- Your data hasn't progressed enough. You need to get to this very quickly, as you can't start building your game until you can at least load the levels/world of your game. So work on getting loading working (from data files) asap.



Week 6
finish seekbar for the game settings actyivity code, it could be change the sounds volume.



Week 7
add code listview for the game progress activity and database system for it. made it could store the user's information about game progress. but there is a conflict with user login database system. It'll be done before next monday.
